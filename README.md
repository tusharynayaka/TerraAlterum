# TerraAlterum
This is my first over-night Hackathon Project
This is a website where the user can explore different features such as:
 1. Locating location and places on the globe(animation)
 2. Getting real weather of a place or location
 3. A tiny ML to predict whether a disaster will occur in future or not (not 100% accurate)
 4. A rough simulation on how our solution helps during a disaster by sending Call, SMS, Email to the respected people in that region.
and much more to be added.
